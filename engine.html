<a name="game-template" class="anchor" href="#game-template"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Game Template</h2>

<p>
All game-specific logic is driven by configuration, 
stored in database table <code>templates</code>.
</p>

<p>
Cards are represented as two-character strings, with first character being
card level and second being card suite, e.g. "AS" for ace of spades.
Levels are 234567890JQKAX (with 0 being 10 and X being joker),
suites are HSDCX (hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs, jokers).
</p>

<p>
Jokers are represented as "XX" "YX" "ZX", so that all card strings are unique.
</p>

<p>
Card glyphs in UI are shown using Unicode symbols in DejaVu Sans font,
e.g. <span class="card hearts">&#x1f0be;</span> for king of hearts.
</p>


<p>
Each game is described with a configuration template in <code>templates.opts<code>:
